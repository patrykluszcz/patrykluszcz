# About Me

I'm a passionate Front-end Developer with a robust background in both Angular and React ecosystems. With a strong grasp of reactive programming and state management in Angular using RxJS and NgRx, I bring dynamic solutions to the table. My experience also extends to unit testing with Jasmine, containerization with Docker, and crafting responsive layouts with HTML and CSS (SCSS). My goal is to leverage my full-stack capabilities, including JavaScript and TypeScript, to build seamless, user-centric applications.
